# Vue 3 + Vite + Firebase

I was trying to use json-server to  create a login page but I learnt the data it provides is a mock data and can't be used when hosted so I had to find a backend server provider to work with and yay, Im trying out firebase for the first time.
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
Used Fakeapi Store for the items, Paystach for the payment method.
